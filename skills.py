"""Skills Assessment: Lists.

To work on an item, uncomment the entire function (including the docstring)
and then run this script. It should output an error that the newly-uncommented
function is now failing its tests.

Edit the function body until you have a solution and the test passes, and then
move on to the next function.

This assessment is DUE TO YOUR ADVISOR BY SUNDAY EVENING.
